# 👁️ RetinaSense

**A Deep Learning-Based Multi-Disease Retinal Disease Classification System**

RetinaSense is a deep learning project designed to automatically classify retinal fundus images into multiple eye disease categories using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks. The project focuses on building an accurate, scalable, and explainable retinal disease screening system.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Detect multiple retinal diseases from fundus images
- Perform automated retinal disease classification
- Build a robust preprocessing pipeline
- Train a deep learning model using EfficientNet-B3
- Provide explainable AI predictions using Grad-CAM
- Deploy the model through a Streamlit web application

---

## 🩺 Supported Disease Classes

- ✅ Healthy Retina
- ✅ Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
- ✅ Glaucoma
- ✅ Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

---

## 📂 Dataset

The RetinaSense dataset is built by combining multiple publicly available retinal image datasets:

- ODIR
- APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection
- ARMD Dataset
- Glaucoma Dataset

After preprocessing:

| Split | Images |
|-------|-------:|
| Training | 8,971 |
| Validation | 1,121 |
| Testing | 1,122 |
| **Total** | **11,214** |
